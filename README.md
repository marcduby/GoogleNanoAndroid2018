* Project 2 (Movies v1)
- For the network check, used technique described in: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1560788/how-to-check-internet-access-on-android-inetaddress-never-times-out
- Referenced the Udacity Android Development course for the layout ideas


* Project 1 (Sandwich Club)
- Note: all starter code (most of the code) in the current subdirectories come from the Udacity Android Nanodegree class repository; I have just modified some of the code based on the requirements of the projects.
- The initial commit of each directory is the original downloaded code of the project from the Udacity repository
